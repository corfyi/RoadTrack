# RoadTrack: Real-Time Distant Parking Detection via Visual Geometric Projection and Velocity Estimation

## 📖 Overview

This project provides the first publicly available distant highway abnormal parking event dataset and baseline implementation. The dataset contains 1,000 video sequences, including 200 abnormal parking event videos and 800 normal traffic videos, providing a reliable training foundation and performance evaluation benchmark for highway abnormal event detection research.

## 🚀 Key Contributions

###  Highway Abnormal Parking Event Dataset
- **Dataset Scale**: 1,000 video sequences
- **Data Distribution**: 200 abnormal event videos + 800 normal traffic videos
- **Annotation Quality**: Provides detailed object detection and tracking annotations
- **Research Value**: Provides standardized evaluation benchmarks for subsequent research

## 🎬 Visualization

The following GIF animations demonstrate the detection process of vehicles transitioning from motion to stationary states at long distances. Green bounding boxes indicate moving vehicles, while red bounding boxes highlight stationary (parked) vehicles that are detected as abnormal parking events.

## 🛠️ Environment Setup

### System Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- SciPy

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependency List
```
numpy
filterpy
lap
scipy
argparse
opencv-python
```

## 🚀 Quick Start


### 1. Run Baseline Method

```bash
python run_baseline.py
```


### 2. Run RoadTrack Method

```bash
python run_roadtrack.py
```

### 3. Run YOLO Video Detection Demo


We provide a demo script in the `yolo_detector` folder for object detection in videos using the YOLO model. The provided `yolo11m.pt` is the weight file used in our paper, and `video.mp4` is a sample test video from our dataset. For access to the complete video dataset, authorization is required.

**Usage:**

1. The `yolo_detector` directory already contains:
   - `yolo11m.pt`: YOLO model weights used in our publication
   - `video.mp4`: A sample test video from the RoadTrack dataset
2. Run the demo script:

	```bash
	cd yolo_detector
	python run_yolo_demo.py
	```

The script will process the sample video and display detection results in real time using OpenCV. You can press `q` to exit visualization.
